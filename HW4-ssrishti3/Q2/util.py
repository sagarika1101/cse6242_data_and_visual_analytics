    # TODO: Partition the data(X) and labels(y) based on the split value - BINARY SPLIT.
    # 
    # You will have to first check if the split attribute is numerical or categorical    
    # If the split attribute is numeric, split_val should be a numerical value
    # For example, your split_val could be the mean of the values of split_attribute
    # If the split attribute is categorical, split_val should be one of the categories.   
    #
    # You can perform the partition in the following way
    # Numeric Split Attribute:
    #   Split the data X into two lists(X_left and X_right) where the first list has all
    #   the rows where the split attribute is less than or equal to the split value, and the 
    #   second list has all the rows where the split attribute is greater than the split 
    #   value. Also create two lists(y_left and y_right) with the corresponding y labels.
    #
    # Categorical Split Attribute:
    #   Split the data X into two lists(X_left and X_right) where the first list has all 
    #   the rows where the split attribute is equal to the split value, and the second list
    #   has all the rows where the split attribute is not equal to the split value.
    #   Also create two lists(y_left and y_right) with the corresponding y labels.

    Example:
    
    X = [[3, 'aa', 10],                 y = [1,
         [1, 'bb', 22],                      1,

    Here, columns 0 and 2 represent numeric attributes, while column 1 is a categorical attribute.
    
    Consider the case where we call the function with split_attribute = 0 and split_val = 3 (mean of column 0)
    Then we divide X into two lists - X_left, where column 0 is <= 3  and X_right, where column 0 is > 3.

              [2, 'cc', 28]]                           0]

               [4, 'cc', 32]]                           1]

    Consider another case where we call the function with split_attribute = 1 and split_val = 'bb'
    Then we divide X into two lists, one where column 1 is 'bb', and the other where it is not 'bb'.
        
    X_left = [[1, 'bb', 22],                 y_left = [1,
